# Introduction

Last month, international superstar Rihanna was crowned a National Hero of Barbados. Her Barbadian-infused tracks—from the inclusion of the “patois of her home region” and the display of common Barbadian musical elements like “reggae backings” and “dancehall beats”—have taken the world and music charts by storm.[^1] However, her songs also shine bright like a diamond for other reasons. For example, “Rude Boy” is “one of her most audibly Bajan” tracks in which she “leaned into her sexuality” on.[^1] Another instance is her song “What’s My Name,” in which Rihanna refutes “the ‘repressive respectability of a conservative gender ideology” by disidentifying with dominant definitions of a ‘lady.'"[^2] Because of this unabashed display of gender and sexuality within her songs in the face of her country's culture that is known for its "reputation for social conservatism," Rihanna is an interesting view into a modern day example of the relationship between Barbados, gender, and sexuality.[^2]

Barbados's history is filled with individuals who provide insight into the dynamics of gender and sexuality on Barbados, whether it is Rihanna in the 21st century or persons who lived centuries ago. In this digital project, pertinent examples will be presented to understand the diverse experiences and instances regarding gender and sexuality in early Alantic Barbados, specifically the era when England was in control of the Caribbean island. 

# Gender and Sexuality in Enslavement

Previously settled by Portugal, Barbados entered a new period of colonial rule in 1627 with the landing of the _William and John_.[^3] In the early years of its British rule, Barbados had mostly British indentured servants who performed a variety of tasks on the island, but within a generation England developed Barbados into a sugarcane- and slave-dominant society marked by plantations.[^6] With the severe importance of sugarcane to Barbados' economy and the need for populations of African slaves to work the growing plantation found across the island, these phenomenon had important ramifications for gender and sexuality for enslaved Africans on Barbados. Jones notes that "planters wielded absolute power on their plantations, and this included the rights to the sexuality of the enslaved."[^4] Slave holders took advantage of this power, which was emboldened by Barbadian law. The court proceeding that formed this legal precedent of matrilenial status inheritance is provided to the right. In Barbados, "white males were therefore free to engage in sexual relationships with enslaved women with impunity" because "any child born to an enslaved woman, regardless of its father's race, social standing or legal status, became the propety of its mother's owner, thus augmenting the enslaved community."[^4] In this context that involved white slave holders taking advantage of their female slaves' sexualities to essentially perpetuate their labor source, female slaves were indelibly affected by this gendered and sexualized phenomenon, both on and off the plantation. 

Interestingly, "the frequency with which black women traversed urban spaces suggests how they were perceived as sexual agents, lascivious, and 'unwomanly'" due to their status as "objects of commerce for different types of (sexual) labor."[^7] This would actually allow a male slave to dress up as a female slave on the orders of his master, traverse the urban streets of Bridgetown, Barbados, and succesfuly enter of the home of his master's enemy in an attempt to kill him. Dudley Crofts, a slave owner, was having an affair with a woman named Agatha Moore, and ordered a male slave of his to go kill Agatha's husband.[^7] An excerpt from the trial against the enslaved boy and Crofts is included to the right. Despite being unsuccessful (the enslaved boy was caught before he could kill Moore's husband), this case highlights the role of gender and sexuality for enslaved women—and those dressed like them—in public Barbados.

# Gender and Sexuality in Freedom

Not all Afrcan women on Barbados were enslaved, but like enslaved women, free women of color also dealt with a gendered and sexualized experience within Barbadian society. [Insert how people became free/were born free.]

# Gender and Sexuality in Whiteness

The previous two sections have only included examples of Black women, due to the dichotomy between enslavement and freedom that existed as a reality for Black women, but not for White women. However, similar to this dichotomy between enslaved and free women of color on Barbados, a separation between poor and elite White women existed. White women were never enslaved on Barbados, but their gender presented a difference between their White male counterparts and themselves. As Jones aptly argues "that the privileges of whiteness simultaneously constrained white women while allowing them the means to counter their gender subordiantion," this unique position of having a subaltern gender in a patriarchial society while also having a privileged skin color in a racist society necessitates study into what the role of gender and sexuality was like for White Barbadian women, both poor and elite.[^4]     

The amount of poor whites on Barbados resulted from the transition from white indentured servitude to black slavery, leaving few waged labour positions for poor white individuals on Barbados.[^4] This had very severe ramifications for white women, due to their lower gender status that left them second in line to jobs after white poor men. While some found waged labour opportunities in positions like nurses and selling fares, other poor white women found paying jobs by being prostitutes and madams on the island.[^4] This disaffected and sexually unrestrained population of poor whites—especially women—made the elite white Barbadians uneasy. Indeed, the "unease about white female transgression was rooted in anxieties about the possibility of sexual relations between poor white women and black men, and the consequences that interracial unions posed for white racial purity and superiority."[^4] This is evidenced in sources from Poor Relief organizations that existed in colonial Barbados to help serve "deserving" poor whites. The Poor Relief organizations—helmed by "patriarchal all-male committee which undoutedly held ideas about appropriate standards of behaviour for white womanhood—"regulated morality and the sexuality of women to preserve white supremacy within Barbados by only giving aid to women who "closely aligned to perceptions of personal character and conduct," and in the context of Barbados' "racially stratified society, white women who formed sexual relations with black men could clearly not be regarded as deserving."[^4] An example of a Minute Book from a Poor Relief organization, in this case one affiliated with the St. John Parish, is provided as an exhibition of the conversation regarding the "deserving" of the poor relief aid for Mary Seeley, a poor white Barbadian woman.

Elite white women also existed within the context of white society on Barbados. Contrasting the notion that the institution of slavery was solely patriarchial, in that men owned and administed slave holdings, Beckles illuminates how Barbadian women also owned slaves. Indeed, "white women were 50 percent of the owners of slaves in Bridgetown, the capital, on properties stocked with less than 10 slaves," and interestingly, "white women also owned more female slaves than males slaves."[^5] The fact that some elite white women were owners, important at that due to their noted urban and female slave holdings, of slaves is important to understand the role of gender and sexuality within white society on Barbados. Because Barbados enjoyed a larger white female population that other British Caribbean colonies, "there was a greater tendency for white women in Barbados to participate in the market economy as autonomous agents, and to establish accumulationist strategies based upon the ownership and possession of slaves," which included white female owners of slaves renting out their slaves for sexual services.[^5] Indeed, Beckles includes the example of Captain Cook, a British military officer, who testified in front of the 1791 Parliamentary Committee on the Slave System regarding these practices by white, female Barbadian slave owners. His testimony illuminates yet another instance of the diverse relationships between gender and sexuality that existed within Barbados society.

# Conclusion

These diverse examples of stories and sources may seem scattered and in part tell a haphazrd tale of what gender and sexuality was like for women in colonial British Barbados. That is indeed the goal of this project. Because there were so many categories for women on Barbados (black, white, free, enslaved, elite, poor, etc.), a broad display is assembled to argue that no one dichotomy could be established for gender and sexuality on the Caribbean island.
