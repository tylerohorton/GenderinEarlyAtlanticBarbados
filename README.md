# Introduction

Last month, international superstar Rihanna was crowned a National Hero of Barbados. Her Barbadian-infused tracks—from the inclusion of the “patois of her home region” and the display of common Barbadian musical elements like “reggae backings” and “dancehall beats”—have taken the world and music charts by storm.[^1] However, her songs also shine bright like a diamond for other reasons. For example, “Rude Boy” is “one of her most audibly Bajan” tracks in which she “leaned into her sexuality” on.[^1] Another instance is her song “What’s My Name,” in which Rihanna refutes “the ‘repressive respectability of a conservative gender ideology” by disidentifying with dominant definitions of a ‘lady.'"[^2] Because of this unabashed display of gender and sexuality within her songs in the face of her country's culture that is known for its "reputation for social conservatism," Rihanna is an interesting view into a modern day example of the relationship between Barbados, gender, and sexuality.[^2]

Barbados's history is filled with individuals who provide insight into the dynamics of gender and sexuality on Barbados, whether it is is Rihanna in the 21st century or persons who lived centuries ago. In this digital project, pertinent examples will be presented to understand the diverse experiences and instances regarding gender and sexuality in early Alantic Barbados, specifically the era when Britain was in control of the Caribbean island.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.

## Map

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.

# Conclusion

These example may seem diverse and in part tell a haphazrd tale of what the gender and sexuality was like for women in colonial British Barbados. That is indeed the goal of this project to display these diverse stories and to show that no one dichotomy could be established for gender and sexuality on the Caribbean island.
