# Introduction

Last month, international superstar Rihanna was crowned a National Hero of Barbados. Her Barbadian-infused tracks—from the inclusion of the “patois of her home region” and the display of common Barbadian musical elements like “reggae backings” and “dancehall beats”—have taken the world and music charts by storm.[^1] However, her songs also shine bright like a diamond for other reasons. For example, “Rude Boy” is “one of her most audibly Bajan” tracks in which she “leaned into her sexuality” on.[^1] Another instance is her song “What’s My Name,” in which Rihanna refutes “the ‘repressive respectability of a conservative gender ideology” by disidentifying with dominant definitions of a ‘lady.'"[^2] Because of this unabashed display of gender and sexuality within her songs in the face of her country's culture that is known for its "reputation for social conservatism," Rihanna is an interesting view into a modern day example of the relationship between Barbados, gender, and sexuality.[^2]

Barbados's history is filled with individuals who provide insight into the dynamics of gender and sexuality on Barbados, whether it is Rihanna in the 21st century or persons who lived centuries ago. In this digital project, pertinent examples will be presented to understand the diverse experiences and instances regarding gender and sexuality in early Alantic Barbados, specifically the era when England was in control of the Caribbean island. 

# Gender and Sexuality in Enslavement

Previously settled by Portugal, Barbados entered a new period of colonial rule in 1627 with the landing of the _William and John_, and within decades England developed Barbados into a sugarcane- and slave-dominant society.[^3]





# Gender and Sexuality in Freedom



    
# Gender and Sexuality in Whiteness

The previous two sections have only included examples of Black women, due to the dichotomy between enslavement and freedom that existed as a reality for Black women, but not for White women. However, similar to this dichotomy between enslaved and free women of color on Barbados, a separation between poor and elite White women existed. White women were never enslaved on Barbados, but their gender presented a difference between their White male counterparts and themselves. As Jones aptly argues "that the privileges of whiteness simultaneously constrained white women while allowing them the means to counter their gender subordiantion," this unique position of having a subaltern gender in a patriarchial society while also having a privileged skin color in a racist society necessitates study into what the role of gender and sexuality was like for White Barbadian women, both poor and elite.[^4]     

The amount of poor whites on Barbados resulted from the transition from white indentured servitude to black slavery, leaving few waged labour positions for poor white individuals on Barbados.[^4] This had very severe ramifications for white women, due to their lower gender status that left them second in line to jobs after white poor men. While some found waged labour opportunities in positions like nurses and selling fares, other poor white women found paying jobs by being prostitutes and madams on the island.[^4] This disaffected and sexually unrestrained population of poor whites—especially women—made the elite white Barbadians uneasy. Indeed, the "unease about white female transgression was rooted in anxieties about the possibility of sexual relations between poor white women and black men, and the consequences that interracial unions posed for white racial purity and superiority."[^4] This is evidenced in sources from Poor Relief organizations that existed in colonial Barbados to help serve "deserving" poor whites. The Poor Relief organizations—helmed by "patriarchal all-male committee which undoutedly held ideas about appropriate standards of behaviour for white womanhood—"regulated morality and the sexuality of women to preserve white supremacy within Barbados by only giving aid to women who "closely aligned to perceptions of personal character and conduct," and in the context of Barbados' "racially stratified society, white women who formed sexual relations with black men could clearly not be regarded as deserving."[^4] An example of a Minute Book from a Poor Relief organization, in this case one affiliated with the St. John Parish, is provided as an exhibition of the conversation regarding the "deserving" of the poor relief aid.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.

## Map

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.

# Conclusion

These example may seem diverse and in part tell a haphazrd tale of what the gender and sexuality was like for women in colonial British Barbados. That is indeed the goal of this project to display these diverse stories and to show that no one dichotomy could be established for gender and sexuality on the Caribbean island.
